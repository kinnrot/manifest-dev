## Plugin Details

### manifest-dev

Manifest-driven workflows separating **what to build** (Deliverables) from **rules to follow** (Global Invariants).

**Core skills:**
- `/define` - Verification-first requirements builder with proactive interview. YOU generate candidates, user validates.
- `/do` - Autonomous execution with enforced verification gates. Iterates deliverables, satisfies ACs, calls /verify.

**Internal skills:** `/verify`, `/done`, `/escalate`

**Review agents:** `code-bugs-reviewer`, `code-design-reviewer`, `code-maintainability-reviewer`, `code-simplicity-reviewer`, `code-testability-reviewer`, `code-coverage-reviewer`, `type-safety-reviewer`, `docs-reviewer`, `claude-md-adherence-reviewer`

**Hooks** prevent premature stopping -- can't stop without verification passing or proper escalation.

**Task guidance** with domain-specific quality gates, risks, and scenarios. Reference material in `tasks/references/research/` provides detailed evidence for `/verify` agents.
