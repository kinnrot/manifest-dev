# BLOG Task Guidance

Blog posts, articles, tutorials, newsletters.

## Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Voice compliance | general-purpose | Matches AUTHOR_VOICE.md / brand docs if they exist |
| Anti-slop | general-purpose | No hedge words, filler phrases, generic listicle patterns |
| Readability | general-purpose | Accessible to target audience, scannable structure |
| Engagement | general-purpose | Opening hook, maintained interest, clear CTA |
| SEO | general-purpose | Title, meta, keywords, headings optimized (if SEO matters) |

## Risks

- **AI slop** - generic phrasing, hedge words, meaningless transitions; probe: what makes this sound human?
- **Wrong depth** - too technical or too shallow; probe: what does audience already know?
- **Missing hook** - reader bounces before value; probe: what's the opening grab?
- **Disembodied voice** - lacks specific experiences, opinions, data; probe: check for AUTHOR_VOICE.md?
- **SEO vs readability** - keyword stuffing hurts prose; probe: how much does SEO matter?

## Trade-offs

- Depth vs accessibility
- SEO vs natural flow
- Opinionated vs balanced
- Comprehensive vs scannable
