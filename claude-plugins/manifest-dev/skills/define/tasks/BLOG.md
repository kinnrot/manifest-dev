# BLOG Task Guidance

Task-specific guidance for blog deliverables: blog posts, articles, tutorials, newsletters.

## Blog-Specific Interview Probes

Surface these dimensions that the general /define flow won't naturally cover:

- **Content format**: Tutorial, opinion/thought-leadership, comparison, announcement, case study? Format drives structure expectations and evidence requirements.
- **Voice & brand docs**: Check for AUTHOR_VOICE.md, BRAND_GUIDELINES.md, or similar. If found, confirm as verification source (encode as INV-G). If not found, probe for tone (conversational vs. formal), personality, and anti-patterns.
- **Audience technical depth**: What concepts can be assumed known? What needs explanation? What jargon is acceptable? This affects every sentence—not just "who reads this" but "what do they already know."
- **SEO/GEO requirements**: Target keywords? Must be optimized for AI citation platforms (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity)? Check for SEO_STRATEGY.md. If SEO matters, encode keyword and structure constraints.
- **Anti-slop stance**: Blog content is highly vulnerable to generic AI output. Probe: what makes this piece sound like a real person, not an AI? Specific experiences, opinions, data, contrarian takes? Encode as INV-G or PG.

## Blog Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Voice compliance | general-purpose | Matches AUTHOR_VOICE.md / BRAND_GUIDELINES.md tone, vocabulary, and anti-patterns (if docs exist) |
| Anti-slop | general-purpose | No hedge words, filler phrases, generic listicle patterns, or corporate-speak; reads as human-written |
| Readability | general-purpose | Accessible to target audience, scannable with clear structure |
| Engagement | general-purpose | Opening hook, maintained interest, clear call-to-action |
| SEO | general-purpose | Title, meta description, keyword usage, heading structure optimized |

**Encoding**: Add selected gates as Global Invariants with subagent verification:
```yaml
verify:
  method: subagent
  agent: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: "Review blog post for [quality aspect]. If voice/brand docs exist, verify compliance. Flag any generic AI-sounding phrasing, hedge words ('It's worth noting', 'In today's landscape'), or filler."
```

## Blog-Specific Risks

These are blog failure modes the general pre-mortem won't surface:

- **AI slop**: Generic phrasing, hedge words, meaningless transitions, listicle-ification—content that reads as machine-generated
- **Wrong depth**: Too technical for audience (lost) or too shallow (insulting)
- **Missing hook**: Reader bounces before reaching the value
- **Scope creep**: Covering too many topics shallowly instead of one topic deeply
- **Disembodied voice**: Content lacks specific experiences, opinions, or data that make it feel authored by a real person

## Blog-Specific Trade-offs

- **Depth vs. accessibility**: Deep technical detail vs. broader audience reach
- **SEO vs. natural flow**: Keyword optimization vs. readable prose
- **Comprehensive vs. scannable**: Covering everything vs. clear, focused structure
- **Opinionated vs. balanced**: Strong stance (more engaging) vs. neutral presentation (broader appeal)

## Blog-Specific AC Patterns

**Structure**
- "Title under 60 characters, includes [target keyword]"
- "Opening hook in first paragraph—specific problem, surprising fact, or contrarian claim"
- "Subheadings enable scanning; reader can get value from headings alone"
- "Ends with clear call-to-action"

**Content**
- "Includes [N] actionable takeaways the reader can apply immediately"
- "Technical concepts explained for [audience level] using concrete examples"
- "Specific data, examples, or experiences support key claims (not generic assertions)"

**Voice**
- "Complies with AUTHOR_VOICE.md / BRAND_GUIDELINES.md (if exists)"
- "No hedge words or filler phrases ('It's important to note', 'In the ever-evolving world of')"
- "Reads as authored by a person with opinions, not generated by AI"

**SEO** (when applicable)
- "Meta description under 160 characters"
- "Target keyword in title, first paragraph, and at least one subheading"
- "Internal/external links where relevant"

## Blog-Specific Process Guidance Patterns

Encode relevant items as PG-*:

- "If AUTHOR_VOICE.md or BRAND_GUIDELINES.md exists, read before writing and use as reference throughout"
- "Write outline first; confirm structure before drafting prose"
- "After drafting, re-read for AI slop: remove hedge words, filler transitions, and generic phrasing"
