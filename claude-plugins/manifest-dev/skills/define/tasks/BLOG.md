# BLOG Task Guidance

Blog posts, articles, tutorials, newsletters.

## Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Voice compliance | general-purpose | Matches AUTHOR_VOICE.md / brand docs if they exist |
| Anti-slop | general-purpose | No hedge words, filler phrases, generic listicle patterns |
| Readability | general-purpose | Accessible to target audience, scannable structure |
| Engagement | general-purpose | Opening hook, maintained interest, clear CTA |
| SEO | general-purpose | Title, meta, keywords, headings optimized (if SEO matters) |

## Risks

- **AI slop** - generic phrasing, hedge words, meaningless transitions; probe: what makes this sound human?
- **Wrong depth** - too technical or too shallow; probe: what does audience already know?
- **Missing hook** - reader bounces before value; probe: what's the opening grab?
- **Disembodied voice** - lacks specific experiences, opinions, data; probe: check for AUTHOR_VOICE.md?
- **SEO vs readability** - keyword stuffing hurts prose; probe: how much does SEO matter?

## Scenario Prompts

- **Lost at transition** - hook works, reader bounces in middle; probe: does each section earn the next?
- **Missing credibility signal** - no reason to trust author; probe: what authority/experience backs this?
- **Actionable clarity gap** - interesting but unclear what to do; probe: what should reader do after?
- **Clickbait disappointment** - title promises more than content delivers; probe: does content match headline?
- **Factual error damages trust** - one wrong claim undermines all; probe: claims verified?
- **Tone mismatch** - doesn't sound like author/brand; probe: check AUTHOR_VOICE.md? brand guidelines?
- **Length mismatch** - too long/short for platform norms; probe: expected length? reading context?
- **Wall of text** - no visual breaks, reader fatigues; probe: headers? images? whitespace?
- **No clear takeaway** - reader finishes, nothing sticks; probe: what's the one thing to remember?
- **Wrong expertise assumption** - assumes knowledge reader lacks; probe: what does audience know?
- **Missing context for sharing** - content good, but no social hook; probe: what makes someone share this?
- **CTA unclear** - reader convinced but doesn't know next step; probe: what's the call to action?
- **Evergreen vs timely confusion** - mixing dated and lasting content; probe: shelf life? update plan?

## Trade-offs

- Depth vs accessibility
- SEO vs natural flow
- Opinionated vs balanced
- Comprehensive vs scannable
