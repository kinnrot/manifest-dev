# RESEARCH Task Guidance

Investigations, analyses, comparisons, technology evaluations.

## Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Source credibility | general-purpose | Key findings backed by Medium+ authority sources |
| Cross-referencing | general-purpose | Claims in conclusions verified across 2+ sources |
| Recency | general-purpose | Sources current for topic velocity |
| Objectivity | general-purpose | Dissenting views included |
| Gap honesty | general-purpose | Knowledge gaps explicitly stated |

**Source authority**: High (official docs, peer-reviewed, creator blogs) > Medium (established publications, top SO answers) > Low (personal blogs, forums, outdated).

## Risks

- **Source bias** - all sources from same perspective; probe: what viewpoints might disagree?
- **Confirmation bias** - only finding evidence supporting initial hypothesis
- **Recency gap** - topic evolved since sources published; probe: how fast-moving is this topic?
- **Coverage gap** - sub-question has no authoritative sources
- **Conflicting authorities** - high-authority sources contradict; probe: present both or resolve?

## Scenario Prompts

- **Conclusion unsupported** - findings don't support recommendation; probe: does evidence lead to conclusion?
- **Key question unaddressed** - stakeholder's real concern not answered; probe: what decision does this inform?
- **Outdated by publication** - topic evolved since research began; probe: will this be accurate when delivered?
- **Scope creep dilutes** - research too broad, depth sacrificed; probe: what's the core question?
- **Wrong comparison criteria** - alternatives compared on wrong dimensions; probe: what matters for decision?
- **Missing alternative** - obvious option not considered; probe: what else could solve this?
- **Hidden framing bias** - question structure predetermines answer; probe: could question be asked differently?
- **Actionability gap** - interesting findings, unclear what to do; probe: what action should follow?
- **Audience mismatch** - too technical or too shallow for reader; probe: who consumes this? expertise level?
- **Confidence overstated** - presented as certain, actually uncertain; probe: what's the confidence level?
- **Context missing** - findings true in isolation, not in our context; probe: does this apply to our situation?
- **Single-source dependency** - key claim rests on one source; probe: corroborated elsewhere?
- **Methodology gap** - how conclusions reached is unclear; probe: can someone reproduce this?

## Trade-offs

- Depth vs breadth
- Recency vs authority
- Completeness vs focus
