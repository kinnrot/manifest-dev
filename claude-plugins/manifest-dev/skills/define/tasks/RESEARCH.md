# RESEARCH Task Guidance

Investigations, analyses, comparisons, technology evaluations.

## Quality Gates

| Aspect | Agent | Threshold |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Source credibility | general-purpose | Key findings backed by Medium+ authority sources |
| Cross-referencing | general-purpose | Claims in conclusions verified across 2+ sources |
| Recency | general-purpose | Sources current for topic velocity |
| Objectivity | general-purpose | Dissenting views included |
| Gap honesty | general-purpose | Knowledge gaps explicitly stated |

**Source authority**: High (official docs, peer-reviewed, creator blogs) > Medium (established publications, top SO answers) > Low (personal blogs, forums, outdated).

## Risks

- **Source bias** - all sources from same perspective; probe: what viewpoints might disagree?
- **Confirmation bias** - only finding evidence supporting initial hypothesis
- **Recency gap** - topic evolved since sources published; probe: how fast-moving is this topic?
- **Coverage gap** - sub-question has no authoritative sources
- **Conflicting authorities** - high-authority sources contradict; probe: present both or resolve?

## Trade-offs

- Depth vs breadth
- Recency vs authority
- Completeness vs focus
