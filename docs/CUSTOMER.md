# CUSTOMER.md - Ideal Customer Profile

> **Purpose**: Define WHO we're building for to guide all product, messaging, and prioritization decisions.

## One-Liner

**Experienced developers frustrated by hype-driven AI coding tools, seeking first-principles workflows that deliver quality output they can trust.**

---

## Primary Persona: "The Quality-First Developer"

### Demographics
- **Experience**: Senior/experienced developers (5+ years)
- **Role**: Full-stack developers, indie hackers, startup engineers
- **Context**: Solo projects, side products, or small startup teams
- **Tool Comfort**: Already uses Claude Code, comfortable customizing dev environment

### Psychographics
- **Mindset**: Quality over speed; willing to invest tokens and time upfront for better autonomous results
- **Frustration**: Exhausted by "shiny object syndrome" - endless new tools/prompts that overpromise and underdeliver
- **Expectation**: Realistic about LLM limitations; wants tools that work *with* those constraints, not ignore them
- **Preference**: Low cognitive load - minimal steps, nothing to memorize, "just follow along and it works"

### The Pain They Feel

> *"I'm sick of trying every new AI coding tool that pops up on Twitter, hoping this one will finally be the holy grail. They all promise magic but produce code I spend hours debugging. I just want something grounded that actually works."*

**Specific frustrations:**
1. AI-generated code requires multiple iterations to get right
2. Too much time spent debugging/fixing AI output
3. Can't trust the agent with larger tasks autonomously
4. Every week there's a new "game-changing" prompt/tool that doesn't actually help
5. Building custom workflows from scratch is time-consuming
6. Copy-pasting prompts from blogs/Twitter is hit-or-miss

## What Success Looks Like

When using this marketplace's plugins, the customer experiences:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Multiple iterations to get working code | Higher quality first-pass output |
| Hours debugging AI-generated code | Reduced debugging time |
| Only trusts AI with small, contained tasks | Confident handing off larger tasks autonomously |
| Chasing new tools hoping one works | Stable, grounded workflows that consistently deliver |
| Slower shipping due to rework | Faster shipping while maintaining quality |

**Success metric**: "I can give Claude a complex task and trust the output enough to ship it with minimal review."

## Problem We Solve

### Primary Problem
Extending Claude Code's capabilities beyond defaults with **quality-focused, first-principles workflows** - not hype-driven prompts.

### Secondary Problem
Sharing proven workflows and best practices with teams, creating consistency in how AI-assisted development is done.

### Our Approach
- **First principles**: Workflows designed around how LLMs actually work, not how we wish they worked
- **Honest scope**: We don't promise the world; we deliver reliable results within realistic constraints
- **Play to strengths**: Maximize LLM capabilities while mitigating known limitations
- **Quality over speed**: Optimize for output quality, not token efficiency or execution time
- **Complexity hidden, simplicity exposed**: Workflows can be sophisticated under the hood, but the user experience is minimal steps, low cognitive load, "just go with it"

---

## Anti-Personas (Who We're NOT Building For)

| Anti-Persona | Why Not |
|--------------|---------|
| **Cost optimizers** | Our workflows may use more tokens for better results; not for those counting every cent |
| **Speed-first developers** | We prioritize quality over raw speed; not for "just ship it" mentality |
| **Tinkerers & customizers** | We provide opinionated workflows that "just work"; not for those who want to tweak everything |
| **Hype chasers** | We're grounded and realistic; not for those wanting revolutionary promises |
| **Non-Claude Code users** | Plugins are specifically for Claude Code ecosystem |

---

## How They Find Us

**Primary channels** (organic, community-driven):
1. GitHub discovery (search, trending, stars)
2. Claude Code community (Discord, forums, official docs)
3. Developer Twitter/X, blogs, newsletters
4. Word of mouth from other quality-focused developers
5. Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, programming subreddits)

**Current focus**: Building for ourselves first; distribution is secondary to getting the workflows right.

## Usage Notes

This document should be referenced when:
- Prioritizing features (does this serve the quality-first developer?)
- Writing copy/documentation (does tone match their expectations?)
- Evaluating new plugins (does this align with first-principles approach?)
- Making trade-offs (quality > cost/speed)
